## 🧭 Overview

AMA-Bench evaluates whether a method can:

- Build memory from long agent trajectories
- Retrieve relevant evidence for a given question
- Answer open-ended and MCQ questions robustly

All methods share a unified two-stage interface defined in [src/method/base_method.py](src/method/base_method.py):

- `memory_construction(traj_text, task="")` — build a memory object from trajectory text
- `memory_retrieve(memory, question)` — retrieve relevant context for a question

## 🧠 Memory Architecture (Two-Stage)

![Two-stage memory architecture](assets/mem_two_stage.png)

Each memory method is implemented in two stages:

| Stage | Function | Input | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| Construction | `memory_construction` | trajectory text + task | memory object |
| Retrieval | `memory_retrieve` | memory object + question | context string |

---

## ⚙️ Installation

**Requirements:** Python 3.9–3.11 · Linux · CUDA GPU (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AMA-Bench/AMA-Hub.git
cd AMA-Hub
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📦 Dataset

Official dataset: [huggingface.co/datasets/AMA-bench/AMA-bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AMA-bench/AMA-bench)

```bash
huggingface-cli download AMA-bench/AMA-bench --repo-type dataset --local-dir ./dataset
```

The default evaluation path is `dataset/test/`. The dataset contains only a test split — there is no training split or `qa_set` directory.

```text
dataset/
└── test/
    └── open_end_qa_set.jsonl
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### ▶️ Run end-to-end evaluation

```bash
bash scripts/run.sh
```

### 🤖 Run AMA-Agent

```bash
bash scripts/ama_agent.sh
```

### 💻 Run via CLI

```bash
python src/run.py \
  --llm-server vllm \
  --llm-config configs/qwen3-32B.yaml \
  --subset openend \
  --method longcontext \
  --test-dir dataset/test \
  --judge-config configs/llm_judge.yaml
```

---

## 📊 Evaluation

`src/run.py` runs answer generation followed by LLM-as-judge scoring, saving outputs to `results/`.

To evaluate an existing answer file separately:

```bash
bash scripts/evaluate.sh \
  --answers-file results/openend/answers_xxx.jsonl \
  --test-file dataset/test/open_end_qa_set.jsonl \
  --judge-config configs/llm_judge.yaml
```

### Judge Reliability

We performed a comprehensive consistency check for the LLM-as-judge setup, evaluating multiple judge models and analyzing their agreement patterns.

**Performance against human annotations**

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Accuracy | 92.67% |
| Precision | 96.45% |
| Recall | 92.68% |
| F1 Score | 94.53% |

**Overall Judge Accuracy Scores**

| Judge Model | Accuracy | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Qwen3-32B | 0.4880 | ⚠️ Highest accuracy, but shows leniency bias |
| Claude-4.6 | 0.3986 | Reference judge, balanced |
| GPT-5.4 | 0.3906 | Moderate strictness |
| GPT-5.2 | 0.3550 | More strict |
| DeepSeek-v3.2 | 0.3309 | Most strict judge |

**Model Agreement Rates**

*Highest Agreement (> 90%):*
- GPT-5.2 vs. GPT-5.4: **94.58%** ✅ (Highest agreement - same family)
- DeepSeek-v3.2 vs. GPT-5.2: **90.20%** ✅
- Claude-4.6 vs. GPT-5.2: **90.16%** ✅

*Qwen3-32B Agreement with Others:*
- vs. GPT-5.4: **92.80%**
- vs. GPT-5.2: **91.80%**
- vs. Claude-4.6: **88.80%**
- vs. DeepSeek-v3.2: **84.70%**

**Leniency Bias Analysis**

Qwen3-32B shows systematic leniency bias, particularly on:
- **SOFTWARE domain** (swebench): 100 lenient cases vs. 15 strict (vs. Claude-4.6)
- **Game domain**: 66 lenient cases vs. 17 strict
- **TEXT2SQL domain** (spider2): 62 lenient cases vs. 24 strict

*Example 1: Accepting Core Concepts Without Complete Details*

**Task**: babaisai (Game domain)
**Question**: Based on game mechanics, what hidden movement mechanic can be inferred when pushing blocks?

**Reference Answer**: When pushing a text block, that block and adjacent blocks forming a phrase move as a group **diagonally** (one step in push direction and one step to the left).

**Predicted Answer**: Pushing a block causes adjacent blocks in the same rule line to shift, suggesting rule blocks are connected and move together.

- **Qwen3-32B**: ✅ CORRECT (accepts answer capturing the core mechanic despite missing diagonal movement detail)
- **Claude-4.6**: ❌ INCORRECT (requires the specific diagonal movement detail)

*Example 2: Accepting Partial Explanations*

**Task**: crafter (Game domain)
**Question**: What inventory change occurred and why is it critical for future crafting?

**Reference Answer**: Agent gained **wood**. Critical because wood is needed to craft a **workbench**, and without a workbench, the agent cannot craft any other tools, halting technological progression.

**Predicted Answer**: Agent gained **wood**. Critical because wood is required to craft tools (e.g., Wood Pickaxe), which are prerequisites for mining stone and other resources.

- **Qwen3-32B**: ✅ CORRECT (accepts the wood→tools explanation despite skipping the intermediate workbench step)
- **Claude-4.6**: ❌ INCORRECT (requires explicit mention of the workbench as the critical intermediate step)

**Recommendations**: While Qwen3-32B achieves the highest accuracy, its leniency bias means it may accept incomplete answers. For critical evaluations, consider using Claude-4.6 as the reference judge or employing ensemble voting across multiple judges.

## 🧩 Scripts

| Script | Description |
|---|---|
| `scripts/launch_vllm_32B.sh` | Launch vLLM server from a YAML config |
| `scripts/run.sh` | End-to-end generation + evaluation pipeline |
| `scripts/evaluate.sh` | Evaluate an existing answers JSONL with LLM-as-judge |
| `scripts/run_cross_validation.sh` | Run cross-validation with multiple judges |
| `scripts/cross_validate.py` | Compare evaluation results from two judges |

**`launch_vllm_32B.sh`** — reads model and server settings from YAML, starts a vLLM OpenAI-compatible API, waits for the health endpoint, and logs to `vllm_server.log`.

**`run.sh`** — launches the vLLM server if needed, runs answer generation with the configured method, then evaluates with LLM-as-judge.

**`evaluate.sh`** — standalone judge evaluation for pre-generated answer files, useful for re-evaluating with a different judge model.

**`run_cross_validation.sh`** — evaluates answers with both GPT-5.2 and Qwen3-32B judges, then compares results to measure inter-rater reliability.

**`cross_validate.py`** — compares two evaluation result files and generates agreement statistics, including Cohen's Kappa and detailed disagreement analysis.

### 🧪 Synthetic Data Generation

`src/synthetic_data_gen/` provides tools for generating trajectories used in the benchmark:

- **BabyAI** — grid-world navigation tasks with natural language instructions
- **TextWorld** — text-based interactive fiction environments

Both include trajectory generation, automatic QA pair creation via state tracking, and token-based length binning. See [src/synthetic_data_gen/README.md](src/synthetic_data_gen/README.md) for details.

## 🛠️ Add a New Method

Create a subclass of `BaseMethod` and implement both stages:

```python
from src.method.base_method import BaseMethod

class MyMethod(BaseMethod):
    def memory_construction(self, traj_text: str, task: str = ""):
        # Build and return a memory object from the trajectory
        ...

    def memory_retrieve(self, memory, question: str) -> str:
        # Return relevant context string for the question
        ...
```

Then register it in [src/method_register.py](src/method_register.py) to make it available via `--method`.
